# MIRA – Coimbatore Water Supply Network Monitoring Application

## Overview

**MIRA** is an advanced tracking and monitoring solution for the **Coimbatore water supply network**. With rapid urbanization, it has become essential to ensure the efficient distribution of water resources. MIRA enables real-time tracking, monitoring, and management of the city's water supply infrastructure, ensuring that water is distributed evenly and efficiently to all regions of Coimbatore.

The app provides a user-friendly platform for both government officials and citizens to track the status of water supply, identify issues like leaks, shortages, or blockages, and optimize water management. MIRA serves as a bridge between water authorities and the public, providing transparency and insight into the water distribution system.

## Features of the Application

### 1. **Real-Time Water Supply Monitoring**
- **Supply Status Updates**: Monitor the current status of water supply across different areas of Coimbatore. Users can check whether water is being distributed, delayed, or interrupted in specific regions.
- **Water Flow Data**: View detailed information on water flow rates, pressure levels, and distribution schedules for each zone.
- **Supply Interruptions**: Track and receive alerts for any disruptions in the water supply, such as maintenance work, power outages, or emergency repairs.

### 2. **Network Visualization**
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the entire Coimbatore water supply network on an interactive map. The map displays pipelines, water tanks, treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure.
- **Zone-Specific Monitoring**: Filter and view water supply data based on geographic zones or neighborhoods, allowing citizens to focus on their local area and government officials to manage specific regions efficiently.
- **Color-Coded Indicators**: Use color-coded markers to quickly identify areas with ongoing water supply, low pressure, or interruptions.

### 3. **Leak Detection and Incident Reporting**
- **Leak Detection Alerts**: MIRA uses sensors and data from the network to detect possible leaks in real-time, notifying relevant authorities of potential issues.
- **User-Generated Reports**: Citizens can report issues such as leaks, burst pipes, or supply irregularities directly from the app, helping authorities respond quickly to problems.
- **Status Tracking for Reports**: Once an issue is reported, users can track its resolution status, ensuring transparency in the management and repair process.

### 4. **Water Usage Analytics**
- **Water Usage Reports**: The app provides data on daily, weekly, and monthly water consumption for different areas, helping users and authorities optimize water usage.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Based on historical data and real-time inputs, the app can forecast water demand trends, allowing for better resource planning and management.
- **Consumption Comparisons**: View and compare water usage across different regions to identify areas with higher or lower demand, guiding policy and infrastructure development.

### 5. **Notifications and Alerts**
- **Supply Alerts**: Receive real-time notifications for water supply interruptions, delays, or shortages in your area.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Stay informed about scheduled maintenance work or infrastructure upgrades that may temporarily affect the water supply.
- **Emergency Notifications**: Receive emergency alerts in the event of critical water supply issues such as contamination, large-scale leaks, or natural disasters.

### 6. **Integration with IoT and Smart Infrastructure**
- **IoT-Based Sensors**: MIRA integrates with IoT sensors placed throughout the water supply network to gather real-time data on water flow, pressure, and quality.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Water authorities can remotely monitor the condition of pipelines, tanks, and other key infrastructure, reducing the need for manual inspections and improving response times.

### 7. **Citizen Engagement and Feedback**
- **Feedback System**: Citizens can provide feedback on water supply quality and overall satisfaction, helping authorities maintain a high standard of service.
- **Community Alerts**: Users can share supply updates with neighbors, helping create a community-based monitoring system.
- **Water Conservation Tips**: The app offers water conservation tips based on the user's consumption patterns, encouraging sustainable water usage.

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile Application**: Built using **Flutter** for cross-platform support on both Android and iOS devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Backend**: **Node.js** and **Express** handle the backend logic, including user authentication, data collection, and reporting. The backend is connected to a **MongoDB** database for scalable storage of real-time water supply data and user reports.
- **Data Visualization**: **Google Maps API** is used for the interactive map, with custom overlays for displaying water supply network data. Data visualization libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js** are used to represent water usage and flow statistics.
- **IoT Integration**: MIRA integrates with **MQTT** and **HTTP** protocols to communicate with IoT sensors placed in pipelines, water tanks, and treatment plants, allowing real-time monitoring of network health.

## How It Works

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Water supply authorities install IoT sensors across key infrastructure points in the Coimbatore water network. These sensors collect real-time data on water flow, pressure, and potential issues, sending the data to the MIRA backend.
2. **Data Visualization**: The data is visualized on an interactive map within the app, allowing both authorities and citizens to view the status of the water supply in different zones.
3. **Issue Reporting**: If users notice an issue, they can report it through the app, triggering notifications to the relevant authorities. The system tracks the status of the report and updates users on the resolution process.
4. **Notifications and Alerts**: Users receive real-time alerts on any changes to their water supply, such as interruptions, leak detections, or maintenance schedules, ensuring they stay informed.
